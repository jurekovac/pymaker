class Lifecycle:
    """Main keeper lifecycle controller.

    This is a utility class helping to build a proper keeper lifecycle. Lifecycle
    consists of startup phase, subscribing to Web3 events and/or timers, and
    a shutdown phase at the end.

    One could as well initialize the keeper and start listening for events themselves
    i.e. without using `Lifecycle`, just that this class takes care of some quirks.
    For example the listener threads of web3.py tend to die at times, which causes
    the client to stop receiving events without even knowing something might be wrong.
    `Lifecycle` does some tricks to monitor for it, and shutdowns the keeper the
    moment it detects something may be wrong with the listener threads.

    Other quirk is the new block filter callback taking more time to execute that
    the time between subsequent blocks. If you do not handle it explicitly,
    the event queue will pile up and the keeper won't work as expected.
    `Lifecycle` used :py:class:`pymaker.util.AsyncCallback` to handle it properly.

    It also handles:
    - waiting for the node to have at least one peer and sync before starting the keeper,
    - checking if the keeper account (`web3.eth.default_account`) is unlocked.

    Also, once the lifecycle is initialized, keeper starts listening for SIGINT/SIGTERM
    signals and starts a graceful shutdown if it receives any of them.

    The typical usage pattern is as follows:

        with Web3Lifecycle(self.web3) as lifecycle:
            lifecycle.on_startup(self.some_startup_function)
            lifecycle.on_block(self.do_something)
            lifecycle.every(15, self.do_something_else)
            lifecycle.on_shutdown(self.some_shutdown_function)

    once called like that, `Lifecycle` will enter an infinite loop.
